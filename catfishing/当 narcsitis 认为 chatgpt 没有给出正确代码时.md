# 当 narcsitis 认为 chatgpt 没有给出正确代码时

When a narcissist thinks ChatGPT doesn't give correct code, they'll likely act in one of these ways:  

1. **Dismissive Superiority** – "This AI is useless! I could do this in my sleep."  
2. **Gaslighting the AI** – "I know for a fact that’s not how it works. Why are you lying?"  
3. **Demanding Validation** – "Are you sure? Because I don’t think you know what you’re talking about."  
4. **Shifting Blame** – "The AI gave me wrong code, and that’s why my project failed."  
5. **Rewriting History** – "I already knew the answer; I was just testing ChatGPT."  
6. **Getting Overly Emotional** – "Wow, even AI is against me now? Unbelievable!"  
7. **Fake Magnanimity** – "It’s okay, ChatGPT. I forgive you for not being as smart as me."  
8. **Copy-Pasting Stack Overflow Anyway** – After all that, they still Google the answer and copy-paste without understanding it.  

Do you have a specific scenario in mind? 😆
